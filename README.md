# StudyRoomReserver

Companion Android app that displays reserved rooms in library (using Springshare software). Uses Firebase Realtime DB, Authentication, and Cloud Messaging.

Notes:
- Written over a weekend for personal use, so use at own risk. ;)
- Removed strings.xml and other key storing files.
- Some of the implemented authentication methods are disabled for simplicity. 
- Information loading from Firebase needs optimizing.
